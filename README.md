# CloudDrive
Cloud service for saving and sharing files with React and Node.js
<p>Cloud service for storing information. The project was inspired by Google Drive. The Backend implements a REST API, authorization and authentication using JWT tokens. All data (about the user, files, etc.) is located in a remote database (MongoDB).</p>
<p>I used design of Xiaoying Riley for better UX </p>
